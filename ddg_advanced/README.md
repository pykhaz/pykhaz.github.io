# DuckDuckGo Advanced Search

A simple **static HTML tool** that provides an extended search interface for [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com).  
It allows you to build advanced search queries using multiple parameters — without remembering the syntax.

##  Features

- **Main topic** — the main keywords for your search  
- **With words** — phrases that *must appear* (in quotes)  
- **Without words** — words or phrases to *exclude* (with a minus)  
- **On site** — restrict search results to a specific domain (e.g. `example.com`)  
- **Excluding site** — exclude results from a domain (e.g. `-site:twitter.com`)

The app automatically constructs the proper DuckDuckGo search query string based on your input.
